In the module of task 7
the following functionality was implemented:

1. classes for the logistics system (accordingly to the task)
- ItemVehicle
- Location
- Order
- LogisticsSystem

2. some additional little changes are implemented
- the system of identifying the orders is based
    on the id of the python objects created,
    so that they remain unique and easily
    and quickly generated;
    the id_dict value of dictionary type
    is added for this reason
- the vehicles can be enabled through
    the special enable_vehicle function
    that takes a vehicle id as its argument

3. functions with tests of the module:
- the default set of tests
- an additional set of tests was implemented
The testing is based on the visual check of the
user-oriented messages rather than on asserts
because of the easier and more comprehensible way
of following the code process
